Tutorial for Particle Acceleration hands on session: CTA School 2017, Sao Paulo

This is the tutorial for the hands on, a practical session on the simulations of test particle acceleration for the [SÃ£o Paulo School of Advanced Science on High Energy and Plasma Astrophysics in the CTA Era](http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~highenastro/). Theere are several goals of this activity:
- to learn how to integrate the particle equation of motion numerically,
- to help you understand how a charged particle moves in the magnetic field, what are the factors this motion depends of,
- to learn how to analyze a single particle motion,
- to learn how to analyze statistical properties of motion of an ensemble of particles.
