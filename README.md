# Particle Acceleration Hands-On

Tutorial for Particle Acceleration hands on session: CTA School 2017, Sao Paulo

This is the tutorial for the hands on, a practical session on the simulations of test particle acceleration for the [SÃ£o Paulo School of Advanced Science on High Energy and Plasma Astrophysics in the CTA Era](http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~highenastro/). Theere are several goals of this activity:
- to learn how to integrate the particle equation of motion numerically,
- to help you understand how a charged particle moves in the magnetic field, what are the factors this motion depends of,
- to learn how to analyze a single particle motion,
- to learn how to analyze statistical properties of motion of an ensemble of particles.

[Pre-requisites](./pre-requisites.md), including instructions for [downloading](./pre-requisites.md#download-links) and [installing](./pre-requisites.md#instructions-for-installing-vm) the VM

# PAccel code

It is a Fortran code which integrates the particle trajectory (proton or electron) in a predefined uniform or curved magnetic field or magnetic field taken from an external simulation.

The code is provided in directoy Particle_Acceleration/00_paccel of your virtual machine image. It can be also downloaded or cloned from my GitHub repository:
```
[fermi@localhost ~]$ git clone https://github.com/gkowal/paccel.git
```
There are a few important files which you may want to modify:
- `make.conf` in which several compilation flags are included,
- `params.in` in which the runtime parameters can be changes.

Once compiled, you can run `./paccel.x` which produces the output like

It also produces an ASCII file called `output.dat` which contains all particle parameters, like position, velocity components, energy, etc.

# Tutorials

## Tutorial 1 - Proton motion in a uniform magnetic field.

In this tutorial we integrate and visualize motion of a proton in magnetic field which is uniform.

Initial steps:
- go to `./00_paccel code/`,
- call `make clean` in the terminal,
- make sure the line `TEST=` in make.config is set to `WAVE`,
- compile the code: `make`,
- copy the executable file `paccel.x` to directory `../01_Buniform/`: `cp ./paccel.x ../01_Buniform/`,
- go to directory `../01_Buniform/`: `cd  ../01_Buniform/`.

The are a few runtime parameters which can be changed in the file `params.in`:
- `ptype = 'p'` or `ptype = 'e'` for proton or electron, respectively,
- `xc`, `yc`, `zc` - the initial particle position,
- `vpar` and `vper` for the parallel and perpendicular component with respect to the direction of the local field, respectively,
- `bini` - the strength of the magnetic field.

In order to visualize the trajectory, energy or velocity components (parallel and perpendicular to the local field) you can use provided [GNUPlot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) scripts: `plot_trajectory.gpl`, `plot_energy.gpl`, `plot_velocity.gpl`

**Task to do**: change some of these parameters and visualize the particle trajectory. Determine the Larmor radius in each case using the data from file `./output.dat`.


## Tutorial 2 - Proton motion in a non-uniform magnetic field. Magnetic mirror.

In this tutorial we integrate and visualize motion of a proton in magnetic field which has a varying curvature. As the results, the particle is trapped bouncing back and forth. This effect is called **magnetic mirror** or **magnetic bottle**.

Initial steps:
- go to `./00_paccel code/`,
- call `make clean` in the terminal,
- make sure the line `TEST=` in make.config is set to `ISLAND`,
- compile the code: `make`,
- copy the executable file `paccel.x` to directory `../02_Bmirror/`: `cp ./paccel.x ../02_Bmirror/`,
- go to directory `../02_Bmirror/`: `cd  ../02_Bmirror/`.

Additionally, to the runtime parameters described in the previous tutorial, you can changed one parameter more in file `params.in`:
- `bamp` - determines the eccentricy of the magnetic field loop; if `bamp = 0.0` the loop is perpectly circular; for `bamp > 0` it is elongated toward the X direction;

In order to visualize the trajectory, energy or velocity components (parallel and perpendicular to the local field) you can use provided GNUPlot scripts: `plot_trajectory.gpl`, `plot_energy.gpl`, `plot_velocity.gpl`

**Task to do**: As in the previous tutorial, change some of these parameters and visualize the particle trajectory. Determine the Larmor radius in each case using the data from file `./output.dat`. Determine the mirror effect condition.


## Tutorial 3 - Proton motion in a turbulent magnetic field.

In this tutorial we integrate and visualize motion of a proton in turbulent magnetic field taking into account the turbulent plasma motion (electric field generated by moving plasma). For this, we need external data stored in the FITS format, which are available in the subdirectory `~/Particle_Acceleration/03_Bturbulent/`.


## Tutorial 4 - Analysis of the statistical properties of ensemble of test particles.

In this tutorial we analyze the statistical properties of an ensemble of test particles. Determine their power spectrum, identify the thermal and non-thermal part, determine the changes of temperature, etc.

The files containig already integrated particle trajectories are provided in your VM image, in the directory `~/Particle_Acceleration/03_Bturbulent/`. We have five files containing data for 1000 particles:
- `time.fits.gz` - time moments for all particle snapshots (Ns);
- `components.fits.gz` - velocity components (total, parallel and perpendicular) for all particles (3 x Np x Ns);
- `energy.fits.gz` - the kinetic energy for all particles at all snapshots (Np x Ns);
- `gperiod.fits.gz` - the gyroperiod for all particles at all snapshots (Np x Ns);
- `gradius.fits.gz` - the gyroradius (Larmor radius) for all particles at all snapshots (Np x Ns);

Above, there are provided the dimensions of arrays stored in each file, where Np is the number of particles and Ns is the number of snapshots.

In the same directory, you will find several scripts written in python, which with the help of packages NumPy and Matplotlib generate evolution of some quantities, e.g. the energy distribution evolution shown below.
