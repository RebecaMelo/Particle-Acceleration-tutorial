# Particle-Acceleration-tutorial

Tutorial for Particle Acceleration hands on session: CTA School 2017, Sao Paulo

This is the tutorial for the hands on, a practical session on the simulations of test particle acceleration for the [SÃ£o Paulo School of Advanced Science on High Energy and Plasma Astrophysics in the CTA Era](http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~highenastro/). Theere are several goals of this activity:
- to learn how to integrate the particle equation of motion numerically,
- to help you understand how a charged particle moves in the magnetic field, what are the factors this motion depends of,
- to learn how to analyze a single particle motion,
- to learn how to analyze statistical properties of motion of an ensemble of particles.

[Pre-requisites](./pre-requisites.md), including instructions for [downloading](./pre-requisites.md#download-links) and [installing](./pre-requisites.md#instructions-for-installing-vm) the VM

# PAccel code

It is a Fortran code which integrates the particle trajectory (proton or electron) in a predefined uniform or curved magnetic field or magnetic field taken from an external simulation.

The code is provided in directoy Particle_Acceleration/00_paccel of your virtual machine image. It can be also downloaded or cloned from my GitHub repository:
```
[fermi@localhost ~]$ git clone https://github.com/gkowal/paccel.git
```
There are a few important files which you may want to modify:
- `make.conf` in which several compilation flags are included,
- `params.in` in which the runtime parameters can be changes.

Once compiled, you can run `./paccel.x` which produces the output like

It also produces a file called `output.dat` which contains all particle parameters, like position, velocity components, energy, etc.

# Tutorials

## Tutorial 1 - Proton motion in a uniform magnetic field.

In this tutorial we integrate and visualize motion of a proton in magnetic field which is uniform.

Initial steps:
- go to `./00_paccel code/`,
- call `make clean` in the terminal,
- make sure the line `TEST=` in make.config is set to `WAVE`,
- compile the code: `make`,
- copy the executable file `paccel.x` to directory `../01_Buniform/`: `cp ./paccel.x ../01_Buniform/`,
- go to directory `../01_Buniform/`: `cd  ../01_Buniform/`.

The are a few runtime parameters which can be changed in the file `params.in`:
- `ptype = 'p'` or `ptype = 'e'` for proton or electron, respectively,
- `xc`, `yc`, `zc` - the initial particle position,
- `vpar` and `vper` for the parallel and perpendicular component with respect to the direction of the local field, respectively,
- `bini` - the strength of the magnetic field.

In order to visualize the trajectory, energy or velocity components (parallel and perpendicular to the local field) you can use provided GNUPlot scripts: `plot_trajectory.gpl`, `plot_energy.gpl`, `plot_velocity.gpl`

**Task to do**: change some of these parameters and determine the Larmor radius using the data from file `./output.dat`.
